<h1>👋 Hi, I’m Lewis</h1>

 <h2>Introduction</h2>
- 👀 I’m interested in many computer science fields and love coding in Java and Python. I would love to be able to
      move into a field within healthcare to help those who need it, or some data science to design for the world's problems
      such as climate change or cleaning the ocean.

  <h2>Skills and Learning</h2>
- 🌱 I have experience with C, C++, Java, Python, HTML5, CSS, Javascript. I am currently learning React, NodeJS, and how to make a PERN app through Codecademy

<br>
- 💞️ I am still a university student so anything that can help me progress would be amazing
