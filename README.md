- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chocciedodger25
 
- 👀 I’m interested in many computer science fields and love coding in Java and Python. I would love to be able to
      move into a field within healthcare to help those that need it, or some data science to design for the world's problems
      such as climate change or cleaning the ocean.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c, c++, java, python, and Web Dev technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any first year projects, I am still a university student so anything that can help me progress would be amazing
 
- 📫 How to reach me: you can reach me here or through LinkedIn at: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewis-beard/
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love Warhammer, if you like Warhammer then we will get on just fine.
