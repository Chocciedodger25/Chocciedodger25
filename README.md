- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chocciedodger25
 
- 👀 I’m interested in many computer science fields and am loving coding in java and python right now. I would love to be able to
      move into a field within healthcare to help those that need it, or some sort of data science to design for the worlds problemns
      such as climet change or cleaning the ocean, something to help those in need.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c, c++, java, python, and Web Dev
 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any first year projects, I am still a university student so anything that can help me progress would be amazing
 
- 📫 How to reach me: you can reach me on here
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have never actually taken an computer science course before and am now doing really well at university
